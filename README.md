## 🐾 Extended Description

The **Tamagotchi Pet Game** is a Python-based virtual pet simulator demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:

- **Classes & Objects:** Each pet has `name`, `age`, `energy`, `hunger`, `health`, `happiness`, and `xp`.  
- **Inheritance:** `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird` inherit from a base `Pet` class, adding unique behaviors.  
- **Encapsulation:** Pet stats are controlled via class methods.  
- **Polymorphism:** Each pet type overrides the `play()` method for unique messages.  

Gameplay includes feeding, playing, sleeping, leveling up, random events, and a leaderboard.
